# drush digitial ocean

Digital ocean support found this solution and I can now update with Drush.

Basically, to resolve this log in as root, and make sure you're in the root user's home directory:

cd ~

After doing this, move the .my.cnf file to rename it:

mv .my.cnf backup.my.cnf

# install composer

reinstall composer
composer require php-ffmpeg/php-ffmpeg
composer require michelf/php-markdown
