Create a file "mylist.txt" with all the files you want to have concatenated
in the following form ( Lines starting with a dash are ignored ) :

# this is a comment
file '/path/to/file1'
file '/path/to/file2'
file '/path/to/file3'


cd videos
ls > list.txt

Note that these can be either relative or absolute paths. 
Then you can encode your files with:

ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4
