make sure the you dont install the realtek driver for the mac

if you have unistall it


1 - dont install the wireless driver for the mac - otherwise backtrack cant load the wireless card

2 - boot BackTrack in Parallels

3 - plug in the usb wireless card - parallels asks if you want to use it with the Mac or Backtrack - select Backtrack

4 - in the terminal type: iwconfig

5 - that lists the wireless as wlan0

6 - to activate the wireless you type: ifconfig wlan0 up

7 - theres an app called wcid that lets you connect to wireless networks like you do on a mac

8 - i selected my network and put in the password and now im on the net in backtrack on parallels with my usb wireless card
