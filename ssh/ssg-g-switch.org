#+STARTUP: content
* ssh g switch for sharing ssh tunnel on the lan as a socks 5 proxy

#+begin_src sh
ssh -g -D 8001 -p 443 username@sshserver.com
#+end_src

+ -g = share ssh tunnel on lan
+ -D 8001 = localport
+ -p 443 = remote ssh port

** search for ssh process id, if you want to kill the connection

#+begin_src sh
ps aux | grep "[s]sh -D"
#+end_src

** You can now connect to the ssh tunnel on the lan as a socks 5 proxy

Change your network setting to connect to the ip address and port of the computer running the ssh tunnel

#+begin_src conf
socks proxy 
ip: 10.0.0.1
port: 8001
#+end_src
