#+STARTUP: content
* git branch
** Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

#+begin_src sh
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
#+end_src

** You can see all branches created by using :

#+begin_src sh
git branch
#+end_src

** switch back to the master branch and then merge

Then you need to apply to merge changes,
if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :

#+begin_src sh
git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop
#+end_src

** Delete a branch on your local filesystem :

#+begin_src sh
git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]
#+end_src

* To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :

#+begin_src sh
git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]
#+end_src
