** browser source

we can play a video with the browser source by adding the embed link as the browser source,
then by right clicking on the browser and selecting interact we get a pop up window where we can interact with the browser source.

this means we can now click on the embedded video to play it

*** youtube embed code with start point

for example we will get the embed code from this video

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnamz5vSdo][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnamz5vSdo]]

open a youtube video and move the playhead to where you want to start playing thye vide from,
then click the share button and select embed

enable the checkbox for start video at which should match the video playhead position,
the format is in seconds

copy the embed code to your clipboard and then paste into a text document and save the file

the embed code will look like this with the start time at 1 minute 29 seconds,
which is 89 seconds in the embed code

#+begin_src html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcnamz5vSdo?start=89" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
#+end_src

*** extract the embed code link

extract the embed link from the src in the embed code

[[https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcnamz5vSdo?start=89][https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcnamz5vSdo?start=89]]

*** append the video end point to the link

the next step is to add the end point to the url to set the videos end point
this is the url we extracted from the videos embed code

[[https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcnamz5vSdo?start=89][https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcnamz5vSdo?start=89]]

we need to append the end point to the url by adding ampersand end equals and then the time in seconds for the end point

for example to set the end point to 2 minutes we have to convert 2 minutes to seconds,
which would be 120

so we need to append the follow code to the url

#+begin_src html
&end=120
#+end_src

the url with the start point set to 89 seconds or 1 minute 29 seconds,
and the end point set to 120 seconds or 2 minutes

[[https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcnamz5vSdo?start=89][https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcnamz5vSdo?start=89&end=200]]

*** obs add browser source

add a browser source in obs studio and the youtube url

then set the width and height of browser source to match the size of your canvas in obs
for example if the size of your canvas in obs is 1920x1080 set the width and height of the browser source to those values

*** interact with the browser

right click on the browser source under sources and select interact,
or right click on the browser source in the canvas and select interact

this will open a small pop up window with the browser source inside which you can click and scroll in

you can now click the youtube video in the pop up window and video will strart playing in the canvas

the disadvantage of this method is that when the video ends recommend videos are shown in the page
