#+STARTUP: content
* nvidia drivers install

ubuntu install nvidia drivers

** check recommended driver

detect the model of your nvidia graphic card and the recommended driver.

#+begin_src sh
ubuntu-drivers devices
#+end_src

** driver install

If you agree with the recommendation use the ubuntu-drivers command again to install all recommended drivers: 

#+begin_src sh
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
#+end_src

Alternatively, install desired driver selectively using the apt command.

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-455
#+end_src

** blacklist Nouveau nvidia driver

create the blacklist-nvidia-nouveau.conf file

#+begin_src sh
sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia-nouveau.conf
#+end_src

add the following code and save the file

#+begin_src conf
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
#+end_src

** reboot

#+begin_src sh
sudo reboot
#+end_src

** switch between nvidia and intel cards

you can switch between using your NVIDIA graphics card (more power) and your Intel card (more power efficient) by running
(note: a reboot is needed after running the command to take effect):

#+begin_src sh
sudo prime-select intel   # switch to intel
sudo prime-select nvidia  # switch to nvidia
#+end_src
