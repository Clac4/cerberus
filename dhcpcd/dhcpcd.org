* Modify the dhcpcd config

dhcpcd's configuration file may be edited to prevent the dhcpcd daemon from overwriting /etc/resolv.conf. 
To do this, add the following to the last section of /etc/dhcpcd.conf:

#+begin_src conf
nohook resolv.conf
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can create a file called /etc/resolv.conf.head containing your DNS servers. 
dhcpcd will prepend this file to the beginning of /etc/resolv.conf.

Or you can configure dhcpcd to use the same DNS servers every time. 
To do this, add the following line at the end of your /etc/dhcpcd.conf:

#+begin_src conf
static domain_name_servers=8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8
#+end_src
