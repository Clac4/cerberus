* How to install Wine from a standard Ubuntu repository

The recommended approach to install Wine on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa Linux is to perform the installation from an Ubuntu repository 
as it will provide you with a stable wine version. 

The WineHQ requires multiarch to be enabled. Therefore the first step is to enable i386 architecture:

#+begin_src sh
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 
#+end_src

** apt update

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt update
#+end_src

*** wine install

Next, to install Wine we need to install both wine64 and wine32 Windows API implementation packages. 
To do so execute the following command:

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install wine64 wine32
#+end_src

+ run winecfg

#+begin_src sh
winecfg
#+end_src

select windows 10 from the drop down click apply and save

* reaper plugins install

#+begin_src sh
wine reaplugs236_x64-install.exe
#+end_src
