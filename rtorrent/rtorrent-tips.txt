# use rtorrent over an openvpn connection, by changing the bind address
start your openvpn connection
sudo openvpn --config vpn.opvn

enter you admin password, and the username and password for the openvpn connection

find the local ip address for the openvpn connection
ifconfig -a

look for the network interface for the openvpn connection
the network interface should be called tun0

next look for the ip address next to inet addr:

inet addr: 10.185.50.1

start rtorrent with the -b option for bind address and add the ip address from the tun0 interface you found with ifconfig -a
rtorrent -b 10.185.50.1
