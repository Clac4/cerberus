Arch Grub-mkconfig Lvmetad Warnings Inside Chroot Install
05 SEPTEMBER 2015 on Linux, arch
When I am installing Arch to logical volumes and attempt to use grub-mkconfig and grub-install from within my chroot environment, I encounter the warning messages:

/run/lvm/lvmetad.socket: connect failed: No such file or directory
WARNING: Failed to connect to lvmetad. Falling back to internal scanning.

The lvmetad service is responsible for the metadata cache for logical volumes. The metadata daemon has two main purposes: It improves performance of LVM commands and it allows udev to automatically activate logical volumes or entire volume groups as they become available to the system.

So to resolve this problem we can make /run available from the host to the chroot environment.

Drop out of your chroot environment:


exit (or control & D) 

mkdir /mnt/hostrun 

mount --bind /run /mnt/hostrun 

arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash 

mkdir /run/lvm 

mount --bind /hostrun/lvm /run/lvm

Alternatively you can disable lvmetad from /etc/lvm/lvm.conf and set use_lvmetad = 0

Then continue with your grub-mkconfig and grub-install commands.

When done, remember to umount /run/lvm before exiting the chroot.
