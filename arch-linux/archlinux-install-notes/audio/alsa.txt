If your sound card order changes on boot, you can specify their order in any file ending with .conf in /etc/modprobe.d (/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf is suggested). For example, if you want your mia sound card to be #0:
/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
options snd_mia index=0
options snd_hda_intel index=1
Use $ cat /proc/asound/modules to get the loaded sound modules and their order. This list is usually all that is needed for the loading order. Use $ lsmod | grep snd to get a devices & modules list. This configuration assumes you have one mia sound card using snd_mia and one (e.g. onboard) card using snd_hda_intel.
