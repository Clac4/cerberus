sudo pacman -S synergy

Pre-configuration

First determine the IP addresses and host names for each machine and make sure each has a correct hosts file.
Arch Linux - /etc/hosts
Windows - C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
OS X - How to Add Hosts to Local Hosts File.
/etc/hosts
10.10.66.1        archserver.localdomain       archserver
10.10.66.100      archleft.localdomain         archleft
10.10.66.105      archright.localdomain        archright

Note: Check that the clients can reach the server.

The configuration file for Arch Linux is /etc/synergy.conf.
If it does not exist, create it using /etc/synergy.conf.example, whose comments should give you enough information for a basic configuration; if you need further reference, read the guide mentioned above.

cp /etc/synergy.conf.example /etc/synergy.conf


Make sure the server port is not blocked. By default, synergy uses port 24800.


The synergy server process needs to attach to your user's X session, which means it needs to run as your user. Enable synergys@username as the appropriate user (replacing 'username' with your username).


You can enable synergys@username.socket to start the server when a client tries to connect instead. This is useful when the service can't connect to an X server on boot.





Starting with systemd:

sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/synergys@.service

To start the service for your user:

sudo systemctl start synergys@username

sudo systemctl start synergys@djwilcox
sudo systemctl stop synergys@djwilcox

systemctl status synergys@djwilcox
