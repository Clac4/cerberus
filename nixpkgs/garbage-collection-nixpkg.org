nixpkg garbage collection

** delete old generations of profile

To delete all old (non-current) generations of your current profile:

#+begin_src sh
nix-env --delete-generations old
#+end_src

After removing appropriate old generations you can run the garbage collector as follows:

#+begin_src sh
nix-store --gc
#+end_src

There is also a convenient little utility nix-collect-garbage, which when invoked with the -d (--delete-old) switch deletes all old generations of all profiles in /nix/var/nix/profiles.

#+begin_src sh
nix-collect-garbage -d
#+end_src
