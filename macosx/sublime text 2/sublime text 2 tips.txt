Sublime text tips

# Access the Command Palette

Similar to TextMate, we can use Sublime’s command palette by accessing the Tools menu, or by pressing Shift + Command + P, on the Mac. Whether you need to visit a Preferences page, or paste in a snippet, all of that can be accomplished here.

# Lightning-Fast File Switching

Press Command + P, type in the name of the file you wish to access (fuzzy finder), and, without even pressing Enter, you’ll instantly be transported to that file.

# Multi-Selection

To enable multi-selection, you have several options:

Press Alt or Command and then click in each region where you require a cursor.
Select a block of lines, and then press Shift + Command + L.
Place the cursor over a particular word, and press Control/Command + D repeatedly to select additional occurrences of that word.
Alternatively, add an additional cursor at all occurrences of a word by typing Alt+F3 on Windows, or Ctrl+Command+G on the Mac. Amazing!!

# Package Control

To install “Package Control,” open Sublime and press Control + `. Next, paste the following snippet into the console.

import urllib2,os;pf='Package Control.sublime-package';ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path();os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None;open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read())

Lastly, restart Sublime Text, and browse to Preferences -> Package Settings. If the installation was successful, you’ll now see a Package Control item in that list.

# You Can Still Use TextMate Bundles

TextMate snippets and themes port over nicely to Sublime Text. 

You only need to drop them in the Packages folder — .tmbundle extension intact, and Sublime will recognize the files. This means that the entire catalog of TextMate themes will work in Sublime!

For example, I’ve been working with the (fantastic) Slim templating engine a good bit lately, and needed better syntax highlighting. Fred Wu created a bundle for TextMate, but, tada, it works perfectly in Sublime Text as well! If you’re interested, you can download the Slim bundle here; it includes both snippets and syntax highlighting.


# Function Crawling

Type Control/Command + r to reveal a popup that allows for this very thing! Even better, the search is fuzzy as well, which is particularly helpful for huge classes.

# create symlink to start Sublime Text 2 from command line

sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
