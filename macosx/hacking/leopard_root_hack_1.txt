   1. Click Restart at the login window
   2. While the computer is restarting, hold down "Command-S" until you see text scrolling through the window. This boots the computer into single user mode.
   3. At the Localhost% prompt type:

      /sbin/mount -uw /
      /sbin/SystemStarter

      You will then see various services starting up.

   4. When the Localhost% prompt reappears, type:

      passwd root

      It will then ask you to type the new root password twice, so do so.

   5. After entering the new password, type:

      reboot

At the login window, enter username root wih the new password. Once you are connected, you can use the Multiple Users application (/Applications/Utilities) to change your normal user's password, or create a new user account.
