vlc airfoil audio delay streaming


set the audio delay in vlc to -2100 so the video stays in sync with airplay audio


Use VLC instead (i.e. choose VLC as the app whose sound AirFoil should capture). Within VLC, use F and G keys to adjust the delay/advance of sound. Usually, an advance (F-key) of -2100 ms is enough. Works great!

open the advanced preferences in VLC and enter the value in Audio desynchronization compensation.
