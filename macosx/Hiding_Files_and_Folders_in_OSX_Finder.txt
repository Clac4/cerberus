Hiding Files and Folders in OSX Finder.....

If you ever have a need to simply hide extraneous files and/or folder entries in Finder you can use the following command:

chflags hidden ~/Movies

This example will hide the "Movies" folder from showing up in Finder. There is a easy way to get to the folder if you decide to later on, just go to Finder's "Go to Folder" menu option.
 
If you want to reset this option you can use the following command:

chflags nohidden ~/Movies

If you want to check a file or folder for hidden files you can issue the following command:
ls -lO
