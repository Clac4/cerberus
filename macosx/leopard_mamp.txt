After that comes setting up Apache. Open up a terminal window, and type in "sudo pico /etc/apache2/httpd.conf". (Note that you must be a computer administrator to access the files in etc/) OS X 10.4 had Apache in /etc/httpd/, and that's part of why it didn't work after the upgrade. Find the line in httpd.conf that looks like "#LoadModule php5_module        libexec/apache2/libphp5.so", and remove the # sign at the beginning. Then search for AddType, and put the following somewhere around it.



After upgrading, I found that there are a few incompatibilities with several applications. Thats to be expected I guess. The two biggies for me is CF 8 and MySQL. I havent managed to get CF 8 running yet but I found a fix for MySQL.

It seems that the preference pane will not work to start or stop MySQL yet so you will have to start it manually from the command line and create a link to the socket file.

First, start MySQL in a terminal window with the following command:

sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld

Then either close the terminal and open a new one, or just hit Command-N to open a new terminal window. Then type the following:

sudo mkdir /var/mysql/

And lastly, create a symbolic link to point the default socket file:

sudo ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/mysql/mysql.sock

I will keep posting things as I find problems and fixes.
