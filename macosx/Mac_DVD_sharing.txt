Mac DVD/CD Sharing 

/*========================================================================================*/

On the Mac with the working DVD drive you want to share

Go to System Preferences Â» Sharing, and enable 'DVD or CD Sharing.' 

If you have your Firewall on it will say DVD sharing blocked by Firewall
You can ignore this it is an error and DVD sharing will work with the Apple Firewall turned on

/*========================================================================================*/

Then, on the computer that does not have the CD drive on it, go to a Terminal window and enter:

defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser EnableODiskBrowsing -bool true
defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser ODSSupported -bool true

Then option click on the Finder icon in the dock and select relaunch Finder

/*========================================================================================*/

After the Finder has relaunched you will now see an icon called Remote Disc in the Finder sidebar

When you click the Remote Disc icon it comes up with the name of the Mac that is sharing its DVD drive

Then you click a button that says Ask to use DVD drive

/*========================================================================================*/


You need to switch back to the Mac that is sharing its DVD drive

You get a an alert message on the screen saying this account on this Mac has requested to use your DVD drive

Click Accept


Now insert the DVD or CD you want to share to your other Mac that doesnt have a working DVD drive

/*========================================================================================*/

Switch back to the Mac with the DVD drive that is not working

Click the Remote Disc icon in the Finder Sidebar and select the Mac that is sharing its DVD drive

You will now see the disc you inserted into the Mac which is sharing its DVD drive


You can now use that disc like you would normally
