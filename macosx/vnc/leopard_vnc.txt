'You cannot share your own computer.' when trying to connect to 'vnc://localhost:[lport]' afterwards. I understand that Apple probably did this to prevent naive users from confusing themselves by connecting to their own systems. However, it's a pain for those who need to connect to localhost for ssh-tunneling. Here's a temporary way to eliminate this restriction:


1 - From the terminal:

defaults write com.apple.ScreenSharing skipLocalAddressCheck -boolean YES

2 - create the ssh tunnel

ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 ip address


3 - launch screen sharing ap

connect to shared computer

ip address = localhost


Look for file com.apple.ScreenSharing.plist and open it with Property List Editor. Look for ShowBonjourBrowser_Debug entry and change Boolean to Yes. Save, exit and open ScreenSharing.
