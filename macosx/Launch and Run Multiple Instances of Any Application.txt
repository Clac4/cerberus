Launch and Run Multiple Instances of Any Application in Mac OS X

Open Terminal, type the command

open -na Safari

The -n option is for “new” or “new instance”. 
The -a option tells your computer you are opening an application, 
so that the path (usually /Applications/) and the extensions (.app) are no longer needed.
