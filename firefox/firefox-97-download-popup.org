* Stop Firefox’s Download Menu From Popping Up

Starting with Firefox 97, whenever you download a file, the download menu opens automatically.
If you find this annoying, it’s easy to turn off with a visit to Firefox’s hidden options. 

First, open Firefox. In the address bar at the top of the window, type about:config and press Enter or Return. 

In the “Search preference name” box, type this (or you can copy and paste it):

#+begin_example
browser.download.alwaysOpenPanel
#+end_example

When you see the item in the results list below,
click the toggle button (two half arrows pointing opposite directions) until you see “false” listed beside it.
