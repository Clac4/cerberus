For correct operation, shared memory support has to be enabled
in Chromium by performing the following command as root:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo sysctl kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1
#+END_SRC

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following
to /etc/sysctl.conf:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1
#+END_SRC
