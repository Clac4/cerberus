* freebsd pefs encryption

pefs encryption

** pefs install

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pkg install pefs-kmod
#+END_SRC

*** pefs load kernel module

Once installed, we next need to load the pefs kernel module:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo kldload pefs
#+END_SRC

check the pefs kernel module is loaded with kldstat

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kldstat
#+END_SRC

If we want to keep this module loaded across reboots, add it to /boot/loader.conf:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo vim /boot/loader.conf
#+END_SRC

+ then add the following line to /boot/load.conf

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs_load="YES"
#+END_SRC

** pefs encrypted directory

create an encrypted directory

create a storage directory in your home directory

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p ~/storage
#+END_SRC

change permissions to make it readable by only our user

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod 700 ~/storage
#+END_SRC

create the pefs keychain with aes256 encryption

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs addchain -fZ -a aes256 ~/storage
#+END_SRC

At the prompt enter you user login password and then confirm

Enter parent key passphrase:
Reenter parent key passphrase:

+ list the ~/storage directory to make sure the ~/storage/.pefs.db file is created

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls -a ~/storage
#+END_SRC

mount the ~/storage directory

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs mount ~/storage ~/storage
#+END_SRC

pefs add aes256 key

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs addkey -c -a aes256 ~/storage
#+END_SRC

Enter passphrase:

+ create a file with some text to test the encryption

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo 'testing' > ~/storage/test.txt
#+END_SRC

+ check the contents of the file and it should be unencrypted

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
less ~/storage/test.txt
#+END_SRC

*** unmount the pefs directory

unmount the ~/storage directory and the file will become encrypted

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs umount ~/storage
#+END_SRC

+ list the storage directory and the filename will now be encrypted

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls -al ~/storage
#+END_SRC

+ check the contents of the file and it should be encrypted

the filename will be changed from test.txt to an encrypted string

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
less ~/storage/.CHkOvB7RVpxPAwD3X8AgG0hltd_sQV59
#+END_SRC

**** remount the pefs ~/storage directory

remount the pefs ~/storage directory

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs mount ~/storage ~/storage
#+END_SRC

re add the pefs key
note you dont have to add the keychain, as you have already created the keychain
you just have to re add the pefs key

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs addkey -c -a aes256 ~/storage
#+END_SRC

you will be prompted to enter your password, which is your user login password

Enter passphrase:

+ list the contents of the ~/storage directory

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls -al ~/storage
#+END_SRC

+ check the contents of the file and it should be unencrypted

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
less ~/storage/test.txt
#+END_SRC
	
*** pefs showchains

pefs showchains for directory
show the key added to the keychain

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pefs showchains -f ~/storage
#+END_SRC

this should show the key is encrypted with aes256 encyption
