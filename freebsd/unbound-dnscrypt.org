* unbound dns server

Select local_unbound during freebsd setup
or install the unbound package

+ switch to root using sudo 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo su
#+END_SRC

+ or doas

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
doas su
#+END_SRC

install unbound dns server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pkg install unbound
#+END_SRC

enable unbound to start at boot 
if you enable unbound during the freebsd the service is called local_unbound

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sysrc local_unbound_enable="YES"
#+END_SRC

** ca_root_nss install

Install the ca_root_nss package which contains the trusted internet root CA servers
This is used by unbound to create the root.key file which is auto trusted

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pkg install ca_root_nss
#+END_SRC

** unbound config

dnscrypt needs - do-not-query-localhost: no
in the custom.conf file in order to work

*** unbound custom.conf

Create a custom.conf configuration file for unbound
switch to root and then create custom.conf

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vi /etc/unbound/conf.d/custom.conf
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
server:
	include: "/var/unbound/unbound_ad_servers"
# include: "/etc/unbound/unbound_outgoing_interface"
	verbosity: 1
	access-control: 0.0.0.0/0 refuse
	access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow
	access-control: ::0/0 refuse
	access-control: ::1 allow
	access-control: ::ffff:127.0.0.1 allow
	
	# enable to not answer id.server and hostname.bind queries.
	hide-identity: yes
	hide-version: yes
	harden-glue: yes
	harden-dnssec-stripped: yes
	
        # dont query localhost needed for dnscrypt-proxy
        do-not-query-localhost: no
# remote-control:
#	control-enable: no
#+END_SRC

*** unbound forward.conf

edit the unbound forward.conf file as root

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vi /etc/unbound/forward.conf
#+END_SRC

replace the contents of the file with the code below
this will use dnscrypt as the forwarder

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
forward-zone:
	name: "."
	forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@5353
#+END_SRC

*** unbound adblocking

Convert the Yoyo.org anti-ad server listing
into an unbound dns spoof redirection list.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget -q -O- --header\="Accept-Encoding: gzip" 'http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&mimetype=plaintext' | \
gunzip | \
awk '/^127\./{
        print "local-zone: \"" $2 "\" redirect"
        print "local-data: \"" $2 " A 127.0.0.1\""
}' > unbound_ad_servers
#+END_SRC

Copy unbound_ad_servers file to /etc/unbound as root

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cp unbound_ad_servers /etc/unbound
#+END_SRC

chown the unbound_ad_servers file as root

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chown root:unbound /etc/unbound/unbound_ad_servers
#+END_SRC

edit the unbound custom.conf file as root

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vi /etc/unbound/conf.d/custom.conf
#+END_SRC

add an include statement to add the unbound_ad_servers to the config file

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
server:
	include: "/var/unbound/unbound_ad_servers"
# include: "/etc/unbound/unbound_outgoing_interface"
	verbosity: 1
	access-control: 0.0.0.0/0 refuse
	access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow
	access-control: ::0/0 refuse
	access-control: ::1 allow
	access-control: ::ffff:127.0.0.1 allow
	
	# enable to not answer id.server and hostname.bind queries.
	hide-identity: yes
	hide-version: yes
	harden-glue: yes
	harden-dnssec-stripped: yes
	
        # dont query localhost needed for dnscrypt-proxy
        do-not-query-localhost: no
# remote-control:
#	control-enable: no
#+END_SRC

* dnscrypt-proxy2

** dnscrypt-proxy2 install

install dnscrypt-proxy as root

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pkg install dnscrypt-proxy2
#+END_SRC

** dnscrypt config

*** dnscrypt-proxy.toml

/usr/local/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml

+ iPv6 blocking

If you don't have IPv6 connectivity, most applications will keep sending DNS queries to resolve IPv6 IP addresses no matter what.

In this scenario, dnscrypt-proxy can immediately respond "there are no IPv6 addresses" instead of sending queries to upstream DNS servers, and waiting for useless responses.

In order to do so, change:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
block_ipv6 = false
#+END_SRC

to:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
block_ipv6 = true
#+END_SRC

You may also want to avoid probing resolvers that are only accessible using IPv6:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ipv6_servers = false
#+END_SRC

*** rc.conf

use the sysrc command as root to add commands to /etc/rc.conf

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sysrc dnscrypt_proxy_enable="YES"
sysrc dnscrypt_proxy_pidfile="/var/run/dnscrypt-proxy.pid"
sysrc dnscrypt_proxy_logfile="/var/log/dnscrypt-proxy.log"
#+END_SRC

we also need to enable unbound in the /etc/rc.conf

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# unbound dns
local_unbound_enable="YES"
# dnscrypt
dnscrypt_proxy_enable="YES"
dnscrypt_proxy_pidfile="/var/run/dnscrypt-proxy.pid"
dnscrypt_proxy_logfile="/var/log/dnscrypt-proxy.log"
#+END_SRC

*** resolv.conf

Stop unbound dns server and take down interfaces before editing resolv.conf

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
doas service local_unbound stop
doas ifconfig ue0 down
doas vim /etc/resolv.conf
doas service local_unbound start
doas ifconfig ue0 up
#+END_SRC

edit /etc/resolv.conf

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Generated by resolvconf
search localdomain
nameserver 127.0.0.1
options edns0
#+END_SRC

avoid overwriting /etc/resolv.conf
edit /etc/dhclient-enter-hooks as root

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vi /etc/dhclient-enter-hooks
#+END_SRC

add the following to /etc/dhclient-enter-hooks

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
add_new_resolv_conf() {
  # We don't want /etc/resolv.conf changed
  # So this is an empty function
  return 0
}
#+END_SRC

protect your /etc/resolv.conf from being modified by setting the immutable (write-protection) attribute as root

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
#+END_SRC
