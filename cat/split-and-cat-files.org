#+STARTUP: showall
* split files into chunk and rejoin with cat

zip the file up first then split it, then rejoin it as a zip with cat
that way when you unzip the file it keeps the original file name

#+begin_src sh
split -b 80m somefile.zip file_
#+end_src

** rejoin files with cat

#+begin_src showall
cat file_* > file.zip
#+end_src
