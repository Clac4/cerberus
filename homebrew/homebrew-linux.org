#+STARTUP: content
* homebrew linux

[[https://brew.sh/][homebrew]] the missing package manager

** homebrew install

open a terminal and run the following command
press ctrl + d at the prompt to install to ~/.linuxbrew

#+begin_src sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#+end_src

** add homebrew to your shell path

edit your ~/.zshenv file

#+begin_src sh
vi ~/.zshenv
#+end_src

add the following code to add homebrew to your shell path

#+begin_src sh
eval "$(/home/djwilcox/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
#+end_src

source your shell config to pick up the changes

#+begin_src sh
source ~/.zshrc
#+end_src

** Configuring Completions in zsh

To make Homebrew’s completions available in zsh, you must insert the Homebrew-managed zsh/site-functions path into your FPATH before initialising zsh’s completion facility. Add the following to your ~/.zshrc:

#+begin_src sh
if type brew &>/dev/null
then
  FPATH="$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions:${FPATH}"

  autoload -Uz compinit
  compinit
fi
#+end_src

This must be done before compinit is called.
Note that if you are using Oh My Zsh, it will call compinit for you, so this must be done before you call oh-my-zsh.sh.

** brew doctor

run brew doctor to check the install

#+begin_src sh 
brew doctor
#+end_src

** Install Homebrew's dependencies if you have sudo access:

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
#+end_src

** We recommend that you install GCC with brew

#+begin_src sh
brew install gcc
#+end_src
