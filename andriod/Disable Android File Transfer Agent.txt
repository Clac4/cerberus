Disable Android File Transfer Agent.app

Download and install the Android File Transfer app

Open it once then quit it

Open Activity Monitor, find the Android File Transfer Agent and quit it (the big stop button in the Activity Monitor toolbar).

And here's the solution to disable the Agent app:
- Go to where you installed "Android File Transfer.app" (I have it under /Applications)
- Ctrl+click --> "Show package contents"
- Go to Contents/Resources
- Rename "Android File Transfer Agent.app" to e.g. "Android File Transfer Agent.app_DISABLED"

Then go to /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Google/Android File Transfer.app and again rename the Agent app. (make sure you've quitted the process before doing this).
